        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of sliced bread per sandwich</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 slices of York ham or cooked ham</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 or 2 slices of the cheese of your choice</li>
            <br>
            <li>butter or margarine</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>steps to follow</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>One of the essential characteristics of the mixed sandwich is the fact that it is prepared with sliced bread. You'll need two slices of bread for each mixed sandwich you're making, so multiply if you're making a few.
            <br>
            Likewise, we can opt for the easy version that will be to buy the bread in any supermarket or opt for preparing it ourselves at home, which, although it is more laborious, will always be much tastier. If you dare to do it, all you have to do is follow this OneHowTo recipe to prepare homemade sliced bread .</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Next, you will have to place two slices of cooked ham or York on one of the slices of bread. If you have bought special cold cuts for sandwiches, the size will probably fit you perfectly, while if the slices are one large piece, you should fold them so that they do not protrude from the bread.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Next, you should do the same with the cheese and put one or two slices on top of the York ham; If you put two, the most appropriate thing would be to put one on each side of the York ham, so that the sausage is in the middle.
                <br>
                As for the variety of cheese, you can choose the one you like the most, although the most recommended are soft cheeses that melt easily: edam, cheddar, havarti, mozzarella, etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The next step will be to put the other slice of bread on top of the ham and cheese and spread both sides of the sandwich with a little butter or margarine , so that when toasted it is golden. If you want the result to be a lighter mixed sandwich, you can skip this step.</li>
            <br>
            <li>On the other hand, you must plug the sandwich maker into the current and wait for it to warm up a bit; in some cases, they have light indicators that indicate when the machine is ready to use it. Next, you should put the mixture in the sandwich maker and close the lid so that the upper plate is on the slice of bread. You will have to wait a few minutes for the cheese to melt properly and the bread to be well toasted</li>
            <br>
            <li>When removing the bread from the sandwich maker, unplug it and be very careful not to burn yourself, because the metal plates acquire high temperatures; Likewise, it is not appropriate to use metal utensils to lift the mixed sandwich to avoid scratching the sandwich maker.
                <br>
                And finally... bon appetit !
