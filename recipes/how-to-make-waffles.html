        <br>
        <p>Waffles need no introduction, but let me tell you that it is a preparation made with flour, milk or water, sugar, egg, lard or butter. The mixture that results from combining all these ingredients is thick or dense, which goes through a cooking process for a super crispy and fluffy dish.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>100 gr of regular wheat flour, not leavened.</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <br>
            <li>50 gr of melted butter</li>
            <br>
            <li>50 ml milk</li>
            <br>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <br>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>steps to follow</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Let's start our recipe by mixing in a bowl the wheat flour, the pinch of salt, the sugar and the baking powder. Mix until they are well integrated.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In another bowl, place the eggs and beat until you get a frothy mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add to the bowl of eggs, melted butter, milk and the tablespoon of vanilla.</li>
            <br>
            <li> With a spatula, mix gently so as not to break up the air in the eggs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now, we are going to integrate the flour to the mixture progressively and beat at medium speed until everything is incorporated and you get a thick creamy texture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once our mixture is ready, proceed to heat your waffle iron. If necessary, you can grease it a little.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is time to pour a little of the mixture into the waffle iron, making sure that it covers the entire surface, but does not spill over.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Cover your waffle iron and let it cook. It usually takes 5 to 6 minutes, depending on your machine. You will know when they are golden brown and delicious.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Repeat the procedure with all the mixture until you have your waffles. Enjoy them</li>
        </ol>
